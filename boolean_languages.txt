The languages differ a little bit more with the 'not equal to' operator:

Language	Syntax	Notes
Python, Java, C, C++, C#	
a != b 

JavaScript	a != b 	If a and b are not the same type, JavaScript will automatically try to convert them to the same type before comparison. To avoid this conversion, you'd use !==.
VB.NET	a <> b	Technically, the <> operator works in most other languages as well for 'not equal to', but != is more common.
Matlab	a ~= b	


Boolean Operators
The three boolean operators--and, or, not--are generally represented in one of three ways: with symbols, with double-symbols, or with plaintext words. Different languages also use slightly different capitalizations for booleans, so we'll use the language-appropriate ones here, too.

Language	Syntax	Notes
Python	True and False  #And
True or False   #Or
not True        #Not	You can also use & (for and) and | (for or) in Python, but they technically do something slightly different. They perform bitwise operations, which we don't cover in this course.
Java	true && false   #And
true || false   #Or
!true           #Not
true ^ false    #Exclusive-Or	You can also use single-operators (& or | instead of && or ||), but it's generally better to use double operators. Double operators only evaluate later conditions if they might change the end result. Java also offers an exclusive-or operator, which is True if exactly one of the two conditions is True, not both or neither.
C	1 && 0   #And
1 || 0   #Or
!1       #Not	C does not natively have boolean types: it treats 0 as False and 1 (or any non-zero number) as True.
C++, C#	true && false   #And
true || false   #Or
!true           #Not	C++ and C# are the same as C, but includes true boolean types like Java.
JavaScript	true && false   #And
true || false   #Or
!true           #Not	
VB.NET	True And False  #And
True Or False   #Or
Not True        #Not
True Xor False  #Exclusive-Or	Following its style, VB.NET capitalizes both the boolean values and the logical operators. It also offers an exclusive-or operator. It also includes two additional operators, AndAlso and OrElse, which function like && and || in Java. For more, see our later interlude on short-circuiting.
Matlab	TRUE And FALSE  #And
TRUE Or FALSE   #Or
Not TRUE        #Not
TRUE xor FALSE  #Exclusive-Or	Matlab also offers an exclusive or operator.
Swift	true && false   #And
true || false   #Or
!true           #Not	
Ruby	true and false  #And
true && false   #Also And
true or false   #Or
true || false   #Also Or
not true        #Not
!true           #Also Not	Ruby lets you use either symbols or words.
